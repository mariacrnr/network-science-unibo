# Network-based Epidemic Model
Network-based Epidemic Model research project for the Complex Systems and Network Science course at the AI MSc @UNIBO.
## Abstract
The research presented in this paper explores the dynamic nature of epidemic evolution by leveraging network science. Focusing on the interplay between network topology, infection dynamics, and recovery mechanisms, the study introduces a comprehensive model incorporating elements from Erdős-Rényi random graph models and real-world face-to-face interaction datasets. Key aspects, such as edge weight evolution, methods for selecting initially infected individuals, and the impact of introducing permanent immunity, are thoroughly analyzed. By simulating the progression of an epidemic over time, the model aims to provide insights into the complex dynamics underlying infectious disease spread.
Comparative analyses with traditional diffusion-based models, including SIS, SIR, and SEIR, contribute to assessing the performance and realism of the proposed approach. The outcomes highlight the need for refined weight evolution mechanisms and suggest potential improvements.
